## About AWX

AWX is Ansible Tower open sourced.  
You can use it if you want to consume your ansible playbooks with:
- GUI
- REST API
- users authentication and permissions. 

Here's the [**AWX FAQ**](https://www.ansible.com/products/awx-project/faq)  
Here's the [**AWX REST API guide**](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible-tower/2.3.0/html/towerapi/index.html)  

## About this repo  

This repository uses Python scripts and YAML variables.  
This repository has automation content that configures an existing AWX setup. If you want to consume Ansible playbooks using AWX, you can use this repository to quickly add these playbooks to AWX.  
This repository has automation content that consumes AWX: you can use this repository to execute playbooks with REST calls.    

This repository doesnt install AWX. You still need to install AWX yourself. 

## How to use this repo 

The steps are:  
- Install AWX. This repository doesnt install AWX. You still need to install AWX yourself.  
- Install the requirements to use Ansible modules for Junos  
- Add the Juniper.junos role from Galaxy to AWX
- Install the requirements to use the python scripts hosted in this repository  
- Clone this repository
- Edit the file [**variables.yml**](variables.yml) to indicate your details such as the ip address of your AWX, the git repository that has the playbooks you want to add yo your AWX, ....
- Execute the script [**configure_awx.py**](configure_awx.py): It uses the variables you defined in the file [**variables.yml**](variables.yml) to configure AWX    
- You can now consume your playbooks with AWX GUI and AWX API!
   - AWX GUI is ```http://<awx_ip_address>```    
   - You can visit the AWX REST API with a web browser: ```http://<awx_ip_address>/api/v2/``` 
   - Execute the file [**run_awx_template.py**](run_awx_template.py) to consume your playbooks from AWX REST API. 

## AWX installation 

This repository doesnt install AWX. You still need to install AWX yourself.  
Here's the [**install guide**](https://github.com/ansible/awx/blob/devel/INSTALL.md)  
Note: By default, AWX database is lost with reboots. You can change this behavior when you install AWX if you prefer AWX to keep its database after system restarts.  
I am running AWX as a containerized application.  
Issue the ```docker ps``` command to see what containers are running.  
```
# docker ps

```

The default AWX credentials are admin/password.  

## install the requirements to use Ansible modules for Junos  

AWX natively includes [**modules for Junos**](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/list_of_network_modules.html#junos)

We need to install in the ```awx_task``` container the requirements to use the Ansible modules for Junos.  

From the server that hosts the AWX containers, run this command to connect to the ```awx_task``` container cli:
```
docker exec -it awx_task bash  
```
Once connected, run these commands from the awx_task container to install the requirements:
```
yum install -y pip python-devel libxml2-devel libxslt-devel gcc openssl libffi-devel python-pip  
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install junos-eznc jxmlease jsnapy
```
Once complete, exit out of the container.
```
exit
```


Alternatively, you can run this command on the server that hosts the AWX containers to install jsnapy jxmlease junos-eznc in awx_task container: 
```
docker exec -it awx_task pip install jsnapy jxmlease junos-eznc
```   
This is the equivalent of running this:
```
docker exec -it awx_task bash  
pip install junos-eznc jxmlease jsnapy
exit
```


## Add the Juniper.junos role

In addition to the [**ansible modules for Junos**](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/list_of_network_modules.html#junos) shipped with AWX, there is also another modules library you can use to interact with Junos.  
These modules are available in the ```Juniper.junos``` role on [**galaxy**](https://galaxy.ansible.com/Juniper/junos/)  
These modules are not shipped with Ansible. 
These two sets of modules for Junos automation can coexist on the same Ansible control machine.  

Run these commands from ```awx_task``` container to download and install the ```Juniper.junos``` role from [**galaxy**](https://galaxy.ansible.com/Juniper/junos/)

Connect to the container cli:
```
docker exec -it awx_task bash  
```

Once connected ```awx_task``` container, run these commands:
```
# more ansible.cfg 
[defaults]
roles_path = /etc/ansible/roles:./
```
```
# ansible-galaxy install Juniper.junos,1.4.3
```
```
# ansible-galaxy list
- Juniper.junos, 1.4.3
```
```
# ls /etc/ansible/roles/
Juniper.junos
```
Once complete, exit out of the container.  
```
# exit
```

Here's the Juniper.junos role documentation: 
- http://junos-ansible-modules.readthedocs.io/en/1.4.3/
- http://junos-ansible-modules.readthedocs.io/


## install the requirements to use the automation content hosted in this repository  
The python scripts  hosted in this repository use the library **requests** to makes REST calls to AWX.   
Run these commands on your laptop:
```
sudo -s
pip install requests
```

## clone this repository
Run these commands on your laptop:
```
sudo -s
git clone https://github.com/ksator/junos-automation-with-AWX.git
cd junos-automation-with-AWX
```

## Define your variables

The file [**variables.yml**](variables.yml) defines variables.  
On your laptop, edit it to indicate details such as: 
- The IP address of your AWX   
- the git repository that has your playbooks
- the list of playbooks from your git repository you want to add to AWX
- the Junos devices credentials
- and some additionnal details

Run these commands on your laptop:
```
vi variable.yml
```
```
$ more variables.yml

## Configure AWX with automation

The file [**configure_awx.py**](configure_awx.py) uses the details in the file [**variables.yml**](variables.yml) and creates: 
- An AWX organization
- An AWX team. The team belongs to the organization created above
- An AWX user. The user belongs to the organization created above
- Credentials for AWX to connect to junos devices. These credentials belongs to the organization created above
- An AWX project. The project belongs to the organization created above. The project uses playbooks from a git repository.
- An AWX inventory. it belongs to the organization created above
- An equivalent AWX template for each playbook from the git repository  

Run this command on your laptop:

```
# python configure_awx.py 
Juniper organization successfully created
automation team successfully created and added to the Juniper organization
ksator user successfully created and added to the Juniper organization
Junos automation project successfully created and added to the Juniper organization

## Consume AWX templates with automation

The python script ```run_awx_templates.py``` makes REST calls to AWX to run an existing awx template.  
Pass the template name as an argument.   
Run this command on your laptop to consume an existing awx template:  
```
# python run_awx_template.py run_pb.check.bgp.yml
waiting for the job to complete ... 
still waiting for the job to complete ...
still waiting for the job to complete ...
still waiting for the job to complete ...
status is successful
```
```
# python run_awx_template.py run_pb.check.lldp.yml
waiting for the job to complete ... 
still waiting for the job to complete ...
still waiting for the job to complete ...
still waiting for the job to complete ...
still waiting for the job to complete ...
still waiting for the job to complete ...
status is successful
```
```
# python run_awx_templates.py non_existing_awx_template_name
there is a problem with that template
```

Verify with the GUI

![job.png](resources/job.png)   
![job.hosts](resources/hosts.png)  


## Delete AWX templates with automation
Run this command on your laptop to delete all AWX templates:  
```
# python delete_awx_templates.py 
```

Note: By default, AWX database is lost with reboots. You can change this behavior when you install AWX if you prefer AWX to keep its database after system restarts.  

## Continuous integration with Travis CI

There is a github webhook with [**Travis CI**](https://travis-ci.org/ksator/junos-automation-with-AWX/)  
The syntax of the python scripts in this repository is tested automatically by Travis CI.  
The files [**.travis.yml**](.travis.yml) at the root of this repository are used for this.  

Here's the last build status [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ksator/junos-automation-with-AWX.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ksator/junos-automation-with-AWX)
